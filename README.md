# Welcome to the party, come on in.

## Job and Hobbies

I'm currently a Systems Administrator for the Apache Software Foundation. I enjoy making things from wook, and being outdoors. I play guitar, speak terrible french, and I program a little on the side.

## Characteristics

I'm shy and trying not to be. it's a rough road but I'll get there. I like to be witty but there's a 50/50 shot no one will
notice.

### Family

I've got three girls and a wife. The girls are happy but not unrealistic about it. We're not big on home automation / voice control technology, or anything with a camera, Not because we're paranoid, but because we get enough of that everywhere else.
